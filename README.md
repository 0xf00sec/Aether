# Aether

Aether is a minimalist macOS implant (x86/ARM) designed for runtime mutation, in-memory encryption, and dead-drop C2, operating entirely via native APIs and Mach-O manipulation.

> This is just a PoC. Some code isn’t fully finished, but if you know what you’re doing, you can extend each module for custom techniques, dynamic C2, stealth, or alternative persistence methods or just extract the engine and use it standalone. 

#### RESEARCH USE ONLY. No funny shit!
