 * 
 * Notes:
 * - This sample is designed to minimize basic detection,
 * - While macOS Gatekeeper may flag it based on static heuristics, 
 * - XProtect consistently fails to detect it due to runtime mutation, 
 * - Originally developed from internal research and shared publicly to demonstrate core techniques.
 * - The structure is designed to be easily extendable for updates, operational fixes, and feature additions.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for demonstrating custom malware development techniques on macOS.
